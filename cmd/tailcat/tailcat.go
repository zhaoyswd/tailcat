const rootLongHelp = `Server mode, accept one connection (any port), write to stdout:

	tailcat

Server mode, given ports (see "tailcat serve --help" for more):

	tailcat serve 22,80,443,8000-8999

Server mode, all ports:

	tailcat serve all

Server mode, certain ports and auth-free SSH:

	tailcat serve 80,no-auth-ssh

Server mode, SSH requiring an authorized public key:

	tailcat serve --ssh-authorized-keys=alice@github ssh

Server mode, exit node (clients can reach the server's whole network):

	tailcat serve exit-node

Server mode, receive files into a directory (a write-only drop box
served to "tailcat cp"; see also serve's files service):

	tailcat recv ~/inbox

Client mode, to default port 1 for stdin/stdout pipe:

	echo hello | tailcat <tc-addr>

Client mode to an explicit port:

	echo "GET / HTTP/1.1..." | tailcat <tc-addr> 80

Anywhere a <tc-addr> argument is accepted, a DNS name whose
"tailcat=" TXT record contains one may be used instead:

	tailcat ssh example.com

But beware: a tailcat address is normally a secret, and a DNS TXT
record is public, so a server named in DNS must authenticate its
clients some other way: --allow at the tunnel layer, or the ssh
service's --ssh-authorized-keys. Never publish a no-auth-ssh server's
address; that gives a shell to anyone who reads the TXT record.

Client mode, ping. Each pong reports whether it arrived via a DERP
relay or a direct path. --until-direct keeps pinging (bounded by
--timeout, default 10s) until a direct path works:

	tailcat ping <tc-addr>
	tailcat ping --until-direct <tc-addr>

Client mode, ssh:

	tailcat ssh [user@]<tc-addr>
	tailcat ssh [user@]<tc-addr> <command> [args...]

Client mode, ssh to specific IP:port via the tailcat address's exit node:

	tailcat ssh -p 10.0.0.1:22 <tc-addr>

Client mode, copy files to or from a server (see "tailcat cp --help"
and serve's files service):

	tailcat cp foo.txt <tc-addr>:
	tailcat cp -r <tc-addr>:dir ./dir

Client mode, list the files a server offers:

	tailcat ls [-l] <tc-addr>[:path]

Client mode, forward local TCP ports to a tailcat server:

	tailcat forward [--bind=<addr>] <tc-addr> <[local:]remote> ...

Client mode, run an ephemeral SOCKS5 proxy and pass its address
as 'all_proxy' environment variable to a child process. Destination
hostnames that are themselves tailcat addresses are dialed as tailcat
servers, so the <tc-addr> argument is optional:

	tailcat socks [--listen=<addr:port>] [<tc-addr>] [<cmd> [args...]]
	tailcat socks <tc-addr> curl http://server.tailcat:8081/
	tailcat socks curl http://<tc-addr>:8081/

With no <cmd>, the SOCKS5 proxy server runs by itself and prints
its address.

Parse a tailcat address and print its encoded fields as JSON:

	tailcat parse <tc-addr>

Resolve a short tailcat address into a longer self-contained one with
embedded DERP server info (see also serve's --full-address flag):

	tailcat resolve <tc-addr>

Print the public key of the client key that would be used (see --key):

	tailcat printpub

Generate and save a persistent server key and print its tailcat address
(run "tailcat genkey --help" for its flags). The key name "default"
is magic: server mode uses it automatically once it exists:

	tailcat genkey --key=default

Generate and save a persistent client key and print its public key,
for use in a server's --allow list. Client modes automatically use
the key named "client-default" when it exists:

	tailcat genkey --client --key=client-default

List or delete saved keys:

	tailcat genkey --list
	tailcat genkey --delete --key=<name>

Print the full documentation (the project README) with more examples:

	tailcat readme

Environment:

	TAILCAT_ADDR_FILE: in server mode, write the tailcat address to the
	given file path or, with a "tcp:" prefix, send it to that TCP
	address.

	TAILCAT_DERPMAP_URL: the default value of the --derpmap-url flag.`

const serveLongHelp = `Run a tailcat server, printing its tailcat address for clients to
connect to. Running tailcat with no arguments is the same as running
"tailcat serve" with no arguments.

The arguments are port numbers, port ranges, and service names,
either as separate arguments or comma-separated. Ports are proxied
to the same port on localhost. Service names are:

	all          serve all ports
	exit-node    run an exit node for all addresses
	ssh          SSH server requiring a public key listed by
	             --ssh-authorized-keys
	no-auth-ssh  auth-free SSH server (the tunnel provides identity;
	             the served process gets the peer's node key in
	             $TAILCAT_PEER_KEY)
	files        file server for SFTP clients like scp and sftp,
	             rooted in the --files directory (default: the
	             current directory, read-only)
	exec         run the command given after "--" for each
	             connection to any port not otherwise served, with
	             the connection as the command's stdin and stdout
	             (like inetd); its stderr is the server's

With no arguments, the server accepts a single connection on any
port, writes it to stdout, and exits.

A command after "--" implies the exec service, unless the ssh or
no-auth-ssh service is also given: then SSH sessions run only that
command in place of a shell (like OpenSSH's ForceCommand), with a
PTY if the client asks for one. Such a server offers no shell, no
client-chosen command, and no SFTP. The client's requested command,
if any, is passed to the command in $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND.

The command in either form gets the peer's node key in
$TAILCAT_PEER_KEY (in --allow's format), and its tailcat IP:port in
$TAILCAT_REMOTE_ADDR.

Flags must come before the port and service arguments.

Accept one connection, write it to stdout:

	tailcat serve

Serve some ports:

	tailcat serve 22,80,443,8000-8999

Serve all ports:

	tailcat serve all

Serve a port and the auth-free SSH server:

	tailcat serve 80,no-auth-ssh

Serve SSH, trusting public keys fetched from GitHub at startup:

	tailcat serve --ssh-authorized-keys=alice@github ssh

Serve SSH, trusting keys from files and a literal public key:

	tailcat serve --ssh-authorized-keys="$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys,ssh-ed25519 AAAA..." ssh

Run an exit node (clients can reach the server's whole network):

	tailcat serve exit-node

Serve the current directory read-only to scp and sftp clients:

	tailcat serve files

Run a command for each connection, with the connection as its stdio:

	tailcat serve exec -- /usr/bin/fortune

Serve SSH that runs only one command, in place of a shell:

	tailcat serve --ssh-authorized-keys=alice@github ssh -- ./deploy.sh
	tailcat serve no-auth-ssh -- git-upload-pack /srv/repo.git

Serve a directory read-write, as a flat write-only drop box, or as a
recursive write-only drop box:

	tailcat serve --files=/pub:rw files
	tailcat serve --files=/inbox:wo files
	tailcat serve --files=/tree-inbox:wo+ files

Serve with a saved key (see genkey) and restrict clients:

	tailcat serve --key=default --allow=nodekey:... 22

Environment:

	TAILCAT_ADDR_FILE: write the tailcat address to the given file
	path or, with a "tcp:" prefix, send it to that TCP address.`

const recvLongHelp = `Run a server that receives files into the given directory (default:
the current directory), printing the tailcat address senders use. It's
shorthand for a write-only file server:

	tailcat serve --files=<dir>:wo files

The sender copies files in with (see "tailcat cp --help"):

	tailcat cp foo.txt <tc-addr>:

Write-only means senders can't make directories, list or read the
directory, touch existing files, or learn whether a requested filename
already exists. Each upload is saved under a new name containing a UTC
timestamp and random suffix, so the tailcat address only grants dropping
files off. To accept directory trees instead, use the less-private
--accept-dirs flag; see its description for the trade-off.

Receive into the current directory, or into a given one:

	tailcat recv
	tailcat recv ~/inbox`

const pingLongHelp = `Examples:

	tailcat ping <tc-addr>
	tailcat ping --until-direct <tc-addr>
	tailcat ping --until-direct --timeout=30s <tc-addr>

Each pong reports whether it arrived via a DERP relay or a direct
path:

	pong in 42.1ms via DERP(sfo)
	pong in 1.2ms via 203.0.113.7:41641

The --until-direct flag keeps pinging (bounded by --timeout) until a
direct path works, exiting non-zero if none does, so scripts can use
it to verify NAT traversal.`

const socksLongHelp = `Examples:

	tailcat socks
	tailcat socks <tc-addr>
	tailcat socks --listen=1080 <tc-addr>
	tailcat socks curl http://<tc-addr>:8081/
	tailcat socks <tc-addr> curl http://server.tailcat:8081/
	tailcat socks <tc-addr> curl https://example.com/

With a <cmd>, the SOCKS5 proxy runs for the life of that command,
which is started with the proxy's address in its all_proxy
environment variable (respected by curl and most CLI tools). With no
<cmd>, the proxy runs by itself and prints its address.

The proxy routes each connection by its destination hostname:

A hostname that is itself a tailcat address names a tailcat server to
dial, so addrs work directly in URLs and the <tc-addr> argument
isn't needed. (Addrs are case-sensitive; this works with CLI tools
but not with browsers, which lowercase hostnames.)

The magic hostname "server.tailcat" means the server named by the
<tc-addr> argument.

Any other hostname or IP is reached through the <tc-addr> server
acting as an exit node, which works only if the server runs with
--serve=exit-node.

The --listen flag sets the proxy's listen address: a bare port means
localhost on that port, a bare address means an OS-assigned port,
and an empty host (as in ":1080") means all interfaces.`

const genkeyLongHelp = `Examples:

	tailcat genkey --key=default
	tailcat genkey --client --key=client-default
	tailcat genkey --key=default --fixed-region
	tailcat genkey --key=default --region=nyc
	tailcat genkey --key=default --region=derp.example.com
	tailcat genkey --region=list
	tailcat genkey --list
	tailcat genkey --delete --key=<name>

By default genkey generates and saves a server key and prints its
tailcat address. The key name "default" is magic: server mode loads it
automatically once it exists. Any other name works too, named at
serve time with --key=<name>, to keep multiple identities.

With --client, genkey generates a client identity key and prints its
public key, for use in a server's --allow list. Client modes
automatically load the magic name "client-default" once it exists.

A server key normally picks its DERP relay region by latency at each
server startup (--region=auto). The --region and --fixed-region
flags bake a region into the key and its tailcat address instead; a
tailcat address published in DNS should do that, so clients and future
server restarts all rendezvous in the same place. --region takes a
region ID, code, or name substring ("list" prints the choices), or
one or more comma-separated DERP server hostnames to use relays that
aren't in the DERP map at all.`
